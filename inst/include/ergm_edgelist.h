/*
Edgelists are so simple, there is no point in definding a struct for
them. They are a serialization for a static network, with minimal
metadata, having the form

<type> edgelist[1+2*nedges] = {nedges,
                               tail[1], tail[2], ..., tail[nedges],
                               head[1], head[2], ..., head[nedges]}

Optionally, it may also include weights:

<type> wtedgelist[1+3*nedges] = {nedges,
                                 tail[1], tail[2], ..., tail[nedges],
                                 head[1], head[2], ..., head[nedges],
                                 weight[1], weight[2], ..., weight[nedges]}

It doesn't affect the search functions. The list shall be sorted by
tails (first column), with ties broken by heads.
