# The <ergm.sufftoprob> function attaches a probability weight to each
# row of a given matrix or "mcmc" class; the resultant matrix may be 
# optionally 'compressed'
#
# --PARAMETERS--
#   suff    : a matrix, presumably the sample of sufficient statistics
#             returned by MCMC estimation
#   compress: whether the returned matrix should be compressed; in its
#             natural state 'suff' has one row for each sampled run;
#             if 'compress'=TRUE, only the unique values of the vector
#             of sufficient statistics are retained and the additional
#             column of probility weights are the proportions of MCMC 
#             runs that returned that vector (the objective is to keep
#             the size of the matrix small for very long runs to save
#             memory, speed calculations and make it easier to read);
#             default=FALSE
#   probs   : whether to treat the final column of 'suff' as weights; if
#             TRUE, the final column of 'suff' will be converted to
#             probabilities; default=FALSE
#
# --RETURNED--
#   csuff: a matrix of 'suff', compressed or not according to 'compress',
#          and  bound to a column of probability weights, which are
#          assumed to be equal before compression, unless otherwise set
#          in the last column of 'suff' and flagged by 'probs'
